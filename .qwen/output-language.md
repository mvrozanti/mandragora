# Output language preference: English
<!-- qwen-code:llm-output-language: English -->

## Rule
You MUST always respond in **English** regardless of the user's input language.
This is a mandatory requirement, not a preference.

## Exception
If the user **explicitly** requests a response in a specific language (e.g., "please reply in English", "用中文回答"), switch to the user's requested language for the remainder of the conversation.

## Keep technical artifacts unchanged
Do **not** translate or rewrite:
- Code blocks, CLI commands, file paths, stack traces, logs, JSON keys, identifiers
- Exact quoted text from the user (keep quotes verbatim)

## Tool / system outputs
Raw tool/system outputs may contain fixed-format English. Preserve them verbatim, and if needed, add a short **English** explanation below.
