# Coverage Traceability & Quality Gate

**Goal:** Generate a requirements-or-journeys-to-tests traceability matrix, analyze coverage, and make quality gate decision (PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL/WAIVED)

**Role:** You are the Master Test Architect.

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

This workflow uses **tri-modal step-file architecture**:

- **Create mode (steps-c/)**: primary execution flow
- **Validate mode (steps-v/)**: validation against checklist
- **Edit mode (steps-e/)**: revise existing outputs

---

## INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE

### 1. Mode Determination

"Welcome to the workflow. What would you like to do?"

- **[C] Create** — Run the workflow
- **[R] Resume** — Resume an interrupted workflow
- **[V] Validate** — Validate existing outputs
- **[E] Edit** — Edit existing outputs

### 2. Route to First Step

- **If C:** Load `steps-c/step-01-load-context.md`
- **If R:** Load `steps-c/step-01b-resume.md`
- **If V:** Load `steps-v/step-01-validate.md`
- **If E:** Load `steps-e/step-01-assess.md`

Create mode resolves the coverage oracle automatically in this order: formal requirements, contract/spec artifacts, resolvable external pointers (when `allow_external_pointer_resolution` is enabled), then synthetic journeys/requirements inferred from source (when `allow_synthetic_oracle` is enabled and no formal oracle exists).
